# VideoObjectDetection
Code and instructions for computer vison object detection in live video.

## **ImageAI Video Object Detection**
ImageAI, created by [Moses Olafenwa](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses), 
is excellent Python software for Computer Vison object detection in still images and video.
This repository focuses on the latter.

Video files in .avi format work best. A small sample video and a large database are accessed 
at [the Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid)](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/).

This first example exhibits, first the sample video pre-object detection processing, then the video processed with the TinyYOLOv3 with ImageAI.
